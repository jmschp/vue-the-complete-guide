# Getting Started

## What is Vue?

> Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a declarative, component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces of any complexity.

## Using Vue

We can use Vue to control parts of our pages, like a chat widget or a sidebar, in a Multi-Page-Application.

Or we can use Vue in a Single-Page-Application (SPA) setup. In this case the server only sends an HTML page, and thereafter Vue takes over the UI.
